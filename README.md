# Comparative-analysis-of-machine-learning-algorithm-for-cardiac-risk-assessment
Globally, 17.9 million people die each year on an average due to Cardio Vascular 
disease while in India, more than 4.77 million people die each year on an average due
to this disease. The health care industry produces a huge amount of data and this 
voluminous data cannot be analysed manually by the limited number of cardiologists 
available. Machine learning algorithms play a vital role in analysing this voluminous 
data and in predicting risk assessment. The medical data such as Age, Sex, Blood 
pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting blood sugar, Resting blood pressure, Chest pain type,
resting electrocardiographic, Maximum heart rate achieved and so on is taken as input 
to machine learning models to predict the risk assessment. In this work, different 
machine learning algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support vector machine and 
decision tree are used for risk assessment. Based on accuracy, performance of these 
algorithms is compared to identify the best possible algorithm for cardiac risk 
assessment.
